Js is synchronous single threaded language which executes sequentially.
We have API's which allow us to write the asynchronous code like setTimeOut etc.
Javascript engine = heap + call stack
Js engine (V8) is always used with some runtime environment like browser, nodejs, deno etc for asynchronous programming.
When Asynchronous code is found, js engine calls the async api like promise, setTimeout, setInterval and that api registers our callback functions in the task queues after completing the async task like completion of fetching data, or waiting for some seconds in setTimeout.
